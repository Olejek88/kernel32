Software for DAQ WinCE (Wincon8000) gas measurement, flow and another parameters calculations. Data acquisition primary values from internal modules and prepare data for API transfer over Http protocol.
Ultragas software package (built on the basis of the Wincon 8000 controller-computer. Data collection from flow sensors, pressure, differential pressure, temperature. Hart protocols (preferably pressure sensors), Uniform (Q-Sonic flow meters), pulse signals, input signals current and voltage, thermocouples.

Data collection from external acquisition controllers, Logika-761, calculation of flow rate by various methods taking into account all characteristics of the pipeline and gas composition.

Generation reports to the printer, system control, viewing settings and current parameters and values from an external matrix display 
Sending data via GSM-modem, via dial-up, automatic sending of sms, in case of failure detection, as well as with current data automatically
Providing data via http-server, in accordance with the Crq 5.65 protocol.
